### To build nginx docker image, and replace the index.html inside the nginx image :

```
$ docker pull nginx
```

### The index.html that I need to replace him inside the image nginx :

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
  <title>Hello World</title>
</head>

<body>

  <h1>Always Smile</h1> 
  <h2>Never give up</h2>

  <p>Have a nice day</p>

</body>

</html>

```

### To replace the index.html inside the image, I've build a Dockerfile :

```
$ nano Dockerfile

  FROM  nginx:latest

  COPY ./index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html

# [Build the Dockerfile]
$ docker build --tag="nginx-docker" .

# [Login inti AWS account]
$ aws ecr get-login-password --region eu-west-2 | docker login --username AWS --password-****n 00********00.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com

# [Tag the image]
$ docker tag nginxdocker 00********00.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/last-repo-euwest2:latest

# [Pushed the image into CodeCommit repo]
$ docker push 00********00.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/last-repo-euwest2:latest
```

### I've pushed the nginx image that built to ECR :

### The services in AWS :

### Then I've created the task definition :
__*A task definition is required to run Docker containers in Amazon ECS.*__

### Inside the cluster, Service, Task and Instance :
__*An Amazon ECS service allows you to run and maintain a specified number of instances of a task definition simultaneously in an Amazon ECS cluster.*__

### The Instances :

### Why I've created the LoadBalancer service :
__*serves as the single point of contact for clients. The load balancer distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, in multiple Availability Zones, This increases the availability of your application. You add one or more listeners to your load balancer.*__

### The final result :

### Part III : ❓ 
## To improve the project :
__*I would add the Route53 (DNS record) :*__
- Is a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name System (DNS) web service
- It is designed to give developers and businesses an extremely reliable and cost effective way to route end users to Internet applications by translating names like www.example.com into the numeric IP addresses like 192.0

__*I would add the Certifcate to the record (HTTPS) :*__
- Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) certificates are used to secure network communications and establish the identity of websites over the internet. Before issuing a certificate for your website, Amazon must validate that you control the domain name for your site.
- After you configure your web server for SSL/TLS offload with AWS CloudHSM, add your web server instance to a security group that allows inbound HTTPS traffic. This allows clients, such as web browsers, to establish an HTTPS connection with your web server.

__*I would add the AWS lambda :*__
> (It's bigger than the current project, BUT I've added because it's related to the web)

- To know how fast your website is working, you can use the CloudFront service.
- It speeds up the sharing of your dynamic and static web content such as .css, .html, and image files to your users. 
- It securely delivers your images, videos, data, and applications to users and clients with high transfer speed and low latency, all within a developer-friendly environment.

**Finally I would added service that give my more security and scalability.**📌
